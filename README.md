Hi, I’m Felix

I am a researcher and mostly code in R for statistics and modelling, but I also create browser-based psychological experiments with javascript.

Big fan of all things open - science, code, data.

My research projects and data are on [OSF](https://osf.io/bq62p/).
More about me on [my website](https://felixschweigkofler.com).
