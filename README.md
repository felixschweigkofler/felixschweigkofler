Hi, I’m Felix

I mostly coding in R for statistics and modelling, but I also created browser-based psychological experiments with javascript.

Looking to expand into python with my next project.

Big fan of line-by-line executability, due to my statistics view on coding.

More about me on [my website](https://felixschweigkofler.com)
