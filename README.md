Hi, I’m Felix

I am a researcher and mostly code in R for statistics and modelling, but I also create browser-based psychological experiments with javascript.

I am using this github account to share useful code.

Big fan of line-by-line executability, due to my statistics view on coding.

More about me on [my website](https://felixschweigkofler.com)
